All the pages content comes from the `data` folder. After opening the data folder you will see all page contents file, like `homepage.yml` for homepage, `about.yml` for about page.

You can change the demo content with your own content, remember that you have to follow the indentation provided in the demo content. If you miss the indentation will get an error. Copy the loop, and change your content. Every loop starts with `-` this symbol.
