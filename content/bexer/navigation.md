1. `weight` is for your navigation sorting, the smaller number weight will show first.
1. For `dropdown menu` you need to add another attribute called `hasChildren = true` , and remove `URL`. then give 1 tab space for understanding hugo that is a children menu item. and paste this `[[menu.main]]` again, then give the `parent =` attribute here. parent name should be the dropdown item name, then give the page `name` and `URL`.
