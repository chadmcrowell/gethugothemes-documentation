For creating a new team member use this command `hugo new content/english/team/john-doe.md` .

## Team Member Configuration

Like with blog posts here you can also find the front matter. For creating a team member item you need to declare the `type = team` and `draft = false`.

You will see some other field for team member, change this content with your content.
