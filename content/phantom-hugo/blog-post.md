 All the page are provided in this template, all the content comes from `data` folder. After open the data folder you will see a file called `database.yml` for every page.

You can easily change the demo content with your won content, just remember that you have to follow the indent that are provided in demo content. If you miss the indentation will get an error. So carefully copy the loop, and change your content. Every loop starts with `-` this symbol.
