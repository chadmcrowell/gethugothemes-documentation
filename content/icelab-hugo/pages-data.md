 Homepage and about page data come` from data `folder. After opening the data folder you will see all page contents file, like `homepage.yml` for homepage, `about.yml` for about page.

You can easily change the demo content with your won content, just remember that you have to follow the indent that is provided in the demo content. If you miss the indentation will get an error. So carefully copy the loop, and change your content. Every loop starts with `-` this symbol.
