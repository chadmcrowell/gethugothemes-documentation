About Page content comes from `data` folder. After open the data folder you will see `about.yml` for about page.

You can easily change the demo content with your won content, just remember that you have to follow the indent that are provided in demo content. If you miss the indentation will get an error. So carefully copy the loop, and change your content. Every loop starts with `-` this symbol.
