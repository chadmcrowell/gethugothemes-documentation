## Getting Started with SITENAME

### Select Path
Open **Terminal** and go to the location where you want to run your site.

### Create a New Site
Create a new site with this command. It will add a folder with your **PROJECT NAME**

```shell
hugo new site my-project
```
![new-project](/images/theme-installation/new-project.png)

## Setup your project with SITENAME

1. **Unzip** the downloaded file, and you will get SITENAME in the themes folder.
![unzip](/images/theme-installation/unzip.png)

2. Copy the `themes/THEMEPATH` into the `my-project/themes` folder, so that you end up with a folder structure like `my-project/themes/THEMEPATH/`
![copy-to-themes](/images/theme-installation/copy-to-themes.png)

3. Copy all files from the `my-project/themes/THEMEPATH/exampleSite` folder into the root directory ( `my-project/` ). It will overwrite existing files and folders of the same name. You can delete the `exampleSite` folder afterward.

4. Go to my-project / root directory. 
```shell
cd parent-directory/SITENAME/
```
![project-dir](/images/theme-installation/project-dir.png)

5. Run this command to serve your project. 
```shell
hugo server
```
![hugo-serve](/images/theme-installation/hugo-serve.png)

6. With this command, you will get a generated URL and open it in your browser. The default URL looks like this [localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313/).
