For creating a new project use this command `hugo new project/new-project.md` .

Project Configuration
---------------------

Just like blog post here you can also find the front matter. For creating a project item you need to declare the `draft = false`.

 One thing is remember that you must need to declare the `type = post`.

You will see some other field for project, change this content with your content.
