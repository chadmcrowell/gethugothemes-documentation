Plugins
-------

You will found plugins in `config.toml` file. Remember that, there is 2 config file. 1 is under the `config/_default` folder, but you need to open the other one, whice is independent. You can add third party plugins from here very easily, We create a loop for plugins, you will see two plugins loop here, first one is for `css` and last one is for `js`. just copy a loop item that you need and paste it in the bottom of the loop. and link correctly, after added a plugins, you maybe need to close the hugo server and run it again for rendered correctly.
