Create your project
-------------------

 Hugo provides a `new` command to create a new website   
`hugo new site theme_name`

Theme Setup
-----------

After creating new site, open this folder and you will find a folder called `themes`. Open this folder and place your downloaded themes here (extracted folder). now open it and you will see a folder called `exampleSite`  
In this folder you need to copy/cut every folder and file, then go back to your root folder that you create with `theme_name` . and paste everything here, it will asked you for replacement file and folder, click on replace, and it will replace with the necessary file. You are all set.

   
Launching the website locally  

------------------------------------

Now you can run this theme in your localhost by this `hugo server`  
command in the root folder directory. and you can see this on   
[localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313/)
