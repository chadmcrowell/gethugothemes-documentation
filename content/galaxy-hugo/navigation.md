Main navigation
---------------

1. `[[menu.main]]` is the main loop, you can add your navigation item by copy and paste this line.
2. `name` attribute is for navigation item name.
3. `URL` is for the page url, just give the page name here, it will automatically add the base URL from your site. like if you want to give the about page url here, just type `about` .
4. `weight` is for your navigation sorting, the smaller number weight will show first.

Footer Navigations
------------------

Footer navigation also follows the same rule that uses main navigation.
